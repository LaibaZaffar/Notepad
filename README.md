## Key Features
**1. Intelligent Suggestions**
Dictionary Integration: The notepad leverages a comprehensive dictionary to provide intelligent word suggestions as users type, improving writing efficiency and accuracy.

**2. Huffman Encoding/Decoding**
The project employs Huffman encoding and decoding algorithms to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data. This cryptographic technique enhances the security of the notepad, making it a reliable choice for handling sensitive information.

**3. User-Friendly Interface**
The notepad boasts a user-friendly interface, making it accessible and easy to navigate. Users can seamlessly explore its functionalities without compromising on simplicity.

## Technical Details
**1. Dictionary Suggestions using B/B++ trees**
The project integrates a carefully curated dictionary, enhancing the suggestion system's accuracy and relevance.

**2. Huffman Encoding/Decoding**
Utilizes Huffman encoding to compress data for storage and transmission, enhancing security and optimizing storage space.

**3. Implementation Language**
Developed using C++ to leverage its performance, efficiency, and versatility.

## Getting Started

To compile and run the Notepad application locally:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LaibaZaffar/Notepad.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd Notepad
   ```

## Acknowledgments
This Notepad application was developed as a practice project to enhance proficiency in **Data Structures and Algorithms** using C++ programming and file handling operations.
